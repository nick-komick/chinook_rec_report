# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

Recreational catch estimation of Chinook salmon in British Columbia has historically been accomplished using a combination of creel surveys and logbook programs. Creel surveys involve overflights to determine effort and dockside fisher interviews. This data is supplemented by logbook programs where guides and lodges voluntarily submit catch data. However, there are substantial spatial and temporal gaps in the creel and logbook data, which targets the most heavily fished areas and months. A mandatory Internet Recreational Effort and Catch (iREC) survey has been used since 2013 to resolve these gaps and contribute to recreational catch information.

iREC is an online recreational catch reporting system that randomly selects recreational licence holders to self-report kept and released fish by adipose clip status for a given month of the year. This survey covers all months and regions. License holders also report if they did not fish, which is equally as important as reported catch. The values from iREC are calibrated against creel survey estimates and combined to fill in spatial and temporal gaps where there are no complete catch estimates provided by the creel program but fishing does occur.

These data have been incorporated into the recreational catch since 2013 in most regions domestically using different methods over time, but this incorporation has not occurred in a systematic and standardized way across the Pacific Region. Furthermore, iREC only begin in July 2012, which can cause issues when interpreting time series that begin before 2013. The catch estimates are an important data need for calculating exploitation rates to meet the requirements of the bilateral Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST) between the US and Canada. The PST outlines a 2009-2015 base period for calculating calendar year exploitation rate (CYER) in Individual Stock Based Management (ISBM) fisheries. This base period used to combine incongruous data sources (a mix of yearly iREC-incorporated and yearly catch estimates without iREC) creating a bias when comparing to current data (yearly iREC-incorporated catch estimates). We resolved these discrepancies by creating a common currency throughout the time series. Our intentsion for these was data revisions to standardize Chinook catch data inputs to both domestic and bilateral PST processes.

A key component to the meeting PST requirements is to provide estimates of fishery impacts on coded wire tag (CWT) indicator stocks.  To more accurately reflect the revised catch estimates in the estimates of CWT recoveries, the stratification and estimation methods were modified to better align to the more complete representation recreational catch in marine waters.

Here, we present:

 1. Revise Chinook catch estimates from 2013-2023; methods to be used for future catch estimates.
 2. Revise Chinook catch estimates from 2005-2012.
 3. Revise coded wire tag estimation stratification to reflect catch estimates.
 4. Incorporation of both sets of revised estimates in bilateral PST processes.
