# Discussion

In this report we describe methods to produce standardized recreational Chinook catch estimates from 2005 to present. Applying and building upon these standardized methods in future years will allow us to continue to maintain and improve catch estimates time series over time. However, the quality of data over the time series varies widely. While the higher sampling rates of recreational licence holders provide higher precision estimates for iREC in recent years, the lack of iREC prior to 2013 and lower sample rates early in the monitoring program lead to lower confidence in earlier years of this time series. The primary reason to extend the time series back to 2005 was to provide consistent estimates for the CTC CYER 2009 to 2015 base period. Future development of fishery assessment metrics should focus on more recent, post-iREC years to reduce potential bias and imprecision when evaluating recreational fisheries.

When fitting the models between creel or logbook, or both, and iREC data for infilling of data for pre-iREC years, most of the model fits were better as non-linear relationships. This is potentially related to the quality control filtering process of creel estimates. As effort increases in a given area in a given month, it likely also increases in adjoining areas and months, resulting in more area and months being included in the regional relationship for the model fit. However, this may not be the case when access to fishers is less of a concern. For example, a logbook program may be able to access fishers at lower efforts and provide an estimate when a creel survey may be less likely to encounter and interview fishers. This is potentially the case in the Haida Gwaii region (NBC AABM), where much of the effort is carried out by lodges that commonly participate in logbook programs. In that case, the logbook catch may have a more linear relationship with iREC catch as the bias is more evenly distributed throughout the much shorter, focused summer fishing season. The non-linearity of relationships between traditional surveys and iREC may also result from the difference in scale among the surveys and higher variability when catch estimates are high. Future efforts should aim to refine these relationships and quantify the causes of their non-linearity. 

Based on our work to date, when considering how to enhance the overall quality of recreational catch estimates in future years, we recommend focusing efforts on improving how existing data are integrated into catch estimation methods and building upon creel and iREC catch monitoring programs, as discussed below.

## Potential Estimation Improvements

The complexity of recreational catch monitoring and the extensive spatial scale of the fishery warrant further exploration of how to better apply the data Canada collects from the fishery. During the development of methods described in this report, we identified several potential improvements that should be considered in future work, including: 

 * revisiting the quality review processes to improve iREC and creel data,
 * improving the iREC-creel calibration process,
 * reviewing CWT submission rate stratification and indirect catch estimation methods,
 * rank-based model selection for pre-iREC catch estimates,
 * incorporating creel and iREC uncertainty into model fits.
 
As described in the methods, we defined and applied standardized data quality reviews of data from both the creel and iREC programs. However, as the iREC program continues to be developed and refined, more nuanced data quality reviews that incorporate additional information (e.g., regulations and narratives provided with survey responses) could be explored. We also identified the potential need to standardize the data quality process across all past years of the iREC survey. This further standardization may improve the fit of modelled relationships between creel survey and iREC data and reduce the overall uncertainty in the resultant catch estimates.

In addition to improvements in the data quality reviews, the calibration between creel and iREC has been identified as a potential area for improvement. Currently, the calibration is carried out annually for each species by their mark status and disposition (i.e., kept or released) for all areas. This is a "one size fits all" approach applied to a diversity of fishing communities and regulatory regimes. The propensity for anglers to respond to the survey and their potential recall bias may vary based on angler experience, their number of trips, or the regulations that apply to the periods or areas they fish. The proportion of fishers that are guided versus unguided and the relative adoption of the avid angler program may also differ among areas and months throughout the Pacific Region, in turn influencing the relationship between creel and iREC from one month or area to the next. Improvements to the calibration process to make it more sensitive to such differences across areas, months, or years may mitigate their potential confounding effects and improve the quality of catch estimates.

Historically, the most consistent and extensive creel program has been run in Southern BC marine waters and, for this reason, it has been applied to iREC calibrations to all regions of BC. However, as above, fisher communities in Central and Northern BC may have different response rates and recall biases compared to Southern BC fishers. Accordingly, the creel and iREC calibration may be improved by incorporating creel data from these areas. However, existing creel programs outside of southern BC are implemented differently and should be reviewed to determine how to effectively incorporate data from them into consistent calibrations of Central and Northern BC iREC catch estimates.

The current model fitting process to estimate catch for years prior to iREC may also be improved through exploring additional model structures and applying more systematic, rank-based model selection. Current model selection was carried out manually in a more exploratory fashion. By defining a greater range of possible models and using a standardized selection process (e.g., $\Delta$AIC or Akaike weights) to identify top model(s) for each combination of region and management regime (or season), we may identify more appropriate models that better reflect the specific dynamics of each catch estimation strata.

Historic catch model fits may also be improved by accounting for uncertainty in all component datasets. A key feature of the iREC calibration process is the use of the error-in-variables approach that incorporates error in both iREC and creel catch estimates. A similar approach could be applied to historic catch models, potentially improving the accuracy and reducing the bias of model fits, resulting in more robust estimates of catch for earlier years in the time series.



## Potential Catch Monitoring Improvements

A key component to our integrated methods of estimating recreational catch is the operation of creel programs. The fisher-dependent nature of the iREC catch reporting can potentially bias catch estimates if it is relied upon solely; as described above, variability in fisher behaviour and participation rates can reduce the accuracy of and bias iREC catch estimates. Going forward, creel programs should continue to be a key component of recreational catch monitoring to ensure the integrity of recreational catch estimates.

Through the application of creel data in the recreational catch estimation methods described in this report, we identified a number of shortcomings that may be mitigated through shifting how the program prioritises monitoring. We excluded some past creel data from our analyses because they were too sparse to meet minimum inclusion criteria due to too few interviews or inadequate fly over coverage for each type of day (weekend or weekday).  Where operationally feasible, it would be more beneficial to focus creel sampling on a smaller set of areas and months where more data can be collected rather than covering a wider spatio-temporal extent at a much lower sampling rate. This would maximize the amount of data from the creel program, particularly in the southern portion of BC, that could be used to accurately calibrate iREC.

One key consideration for the iREC program is how effective fishers are at communicating their catch data through the iREC reporting website. Issues, such as misunderstanding the questions posed by the iREC survey or recall bias related to the time lag between catch and reporting, can reduce the quality of iREC data. Currently, the primary way to address these issues is to manually review comments provided by individual fishers. This may help resolve uncertainty in data due to misinterpreting survey questions and other issues with data entry, but is time intensive and subjective. [[[[[[However, a more effective approach maybe to explore collecting fisher identification information during creel interviews (e.g. iREC access keys). The limited number of creel interviews in relation to the spatial and temporal coverage of iREC responses will likely not be informative to the calibration. However, the creel interviews maybe used as an addition data set to identify potential systematic issues with how fishers use or understand how they use the website.]]]]]] ---- NRS: I just don't get how these last three sentences fit together - how will collecting identification info be more effective than manually reviewing interview comments? why does the limited number of interviews relative to the overall extent of the iREC program make it uninformative to the calibration? I get that they could be informative to identifying potential systematic issues with how fishers interact with the program...  

A common concern with the iREC responses is recall bias that may result from the time lag between when the fishing event occurred and when they report the data.  This lag could be almost a full month between releasing a fish and reporting the release through iREC. Any way to reduce this lag could potentially improve the overall accuracy of these reports, especially releases. One approach is to encourage fishers to record all catch on a catch report log while on the water. DFO freely provides a document template ^[https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/rec/docs/track_catch-saisie_prises-eng.pdf] that can be printed out and carried by fishers while fishing. As an alternative, an electronic version of the catch log could be developed that would allow fishers to record catch information on a mobile device. [[[[[Any catch log solution must meet all the reporting needs of iREC (e.g. it must allow fishers to log all species and mark status for specific salmon species) to ensure the quality of catch monitoring program.]]]]] - NRS: is this last sentence necessary, doesn't it sort of go without saying?

In general, the effectiveness of iREC is contingent on fishers knowing their responsibility to report their catch when they purchase a recreational licence. One demographic that can be challenging to collect quality data from in particular is guided fishers. These licence holders may be less aware of fishing regulations, reporting requirements, the area in which they were fishing, the species identification of fish they caught, or what fish they may have released. One solution is for guides to facilitate their patrons' reporting. This could be accomplished through a range of actions, from a targeted communication campaign with guides, to making guide reporting on behalf of patrons' mandatory. These approaches should be explored to ensure the quality of response data from the iREC program.

# Conclusion
 
The primary goal of this work has been to incorporate direct catch estimation into a systematic, standardized, and replicable approach to better represent Canadian marine recreational fisheries impacts on Chinook stocks. Prior to this work, multiple methods were inconsistently applied to incorporate catch data from different sources to the estimation process. This most recent update standardizes how the data is integrated into recreational CWT estimates and how inconsistencies between sampling and catch estimates are handled. These updates leverage direct measurements and systematic methods to better reflect the recreational fishery impacts on CWT indicator stocks from 2005 to present. The revised methods described in this report provide a framework for ongoing improvements to better utilize recreational catch monitoring data and inform the operation and refinement of catch monitoring programs into the future.
