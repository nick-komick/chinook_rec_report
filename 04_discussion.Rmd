# Discussion

The methods we presented in this report provides standardized recreational catch estimates from 2005 to present. However, the quality of data over the time series is quite varied.  While the higher sampling rates of recreational licence holders provides higher precision estimates for iREC in recent years, the lack of iREC before 2013 and the lower sample rates early in the monitoring program leads to lower confidence in earlier years of this time series.  The primary reason to extend the time series back to 2005 was to provide consistent estimates for the CTC CYER base period of 2009 to 2015.  Future development of fishery assessment metrics should focus on using more recent, post iREC, years to reduce potential bias and imprecision when evaluating recreational fisheries.

When fitting the models between creel/log-book and iREC data for infilling of pre-iREC years, most of the model fits were better as non-linear relationships.  This is potentially related to the quality control filtering process of creel estimates.  As effort increases in an area and month combination, there is likely effort increases in adjoining areas and months.  This would result in more areas/months being included in the regional relationship for the model fit.  However, this may not be the case when access to fishers is less of a concern. For example, a log book program maybe able to access fishers at lower efforts and may provide an estimate when a creel survey maybe less likely to encounter and interview fishers.  This is potentially the case in the Haida Gwaii region (NBC AABM), where much of the effort is carried out by lodges that commonly participate on log book programs. In that case, the log book catch may have a more linear relationship with iREC catch as the bias is more evenly distributed throughout the much shorter and focused fishing season during the summer.

A benefit of standardizing the methods over the 2005 to present period allows us to enhance the quality of recreational catch estimates in the future.  When looking at where to enhance the overall quality of recreational catch, efforts should be placed on improving the methods of how the data is integrated and catch monitoring programs.  Each of these is discussed in the sections below.

## Potential Method Improvements

The complexity of recreational catch monitoring and the vast spatial extent of the fishery lends itself to further exploration on how to better use the data Canada collects from the recreational sector. Several potential approaches to improving this these estimates have been identified and may be incorporated in the future estimates, including: 

 * Data quality review processes to improve iREC and creel data
 * Improved iREC-creel calibration process
 * Review of CWT submission rate stratification and indirect catch estimation methods
 * Ranked model selection for pre-iREC catch estimates
 * Incorporate creel and iREC uncertainty into model fits
 
As identified in the methods, there was defined data quality review methods applied to both creel and iREC. However, with the maturing nature of the iREC program, there is potential to explore more nuanced data quality reviews that incorporate additional information (e.g. regulations and narratives provided with survey responses). One area of improvement that has been identified is the potential need to standardize the data quality process across all past years of the survey. This should improve the relationship will the creel survey and reduce the overall uncertainty in the estimates.

In addition to the iREC data quality review, the calibration between creel and iREC has been identified as a potential area of improvement. Currently the calibration is carried out annual for each species by their mark status and disposition (i.e. kept or released) for all areas. This approach is a one size fits all for a diverse number fishing communities and regulatory regimes. The propensity for anglers to respond to the survey and their potential recall bias may be different based on angler experience, the number of trips, or regulations. As different areas and months through out the Pacific Region can consist of more avid anglers or guides, which may influence the relationship between creel and iREC from the Johnstone Strait to Juan de Fuca Strait. An improved calibration method may be more sensitive to differences across areas, months, or years.

The creel and iREC calibration could also potentially be improved by incorporating creel data from areas outside of Southern BC. Historically, the most consistent and extensive creel program has been run in Southern BC marine waters. However, similar to the potential calibration improvement, fisher communities in Central and Northern BC may have different response rates and recall bias compared to Southern BC fishers. However, existing creel programs outside of southern BC are run different and may require review on how best to incorporate data from those creel programs into a consistent method of calibration north and central coast iREC catch estimates.

Similar to the creel and iREC calibration, the historic model fitting to estimate catch before iREC maybe improved through a more extensive rank model fit analysis. The current model selections was carried out in a more manual and exploratory fashion. By defining greater range of potential models and using a standardized rank model selection to identify the specific model for each combination of region and management regime, the analysis might identify more appropriate models that better reflect the specific dynamics of each strata (i.e. region and season).

Another potential approach to improving the historic catch model fit is by inclusion uncertainty.  A key feature of the iREC calibration process is the using of type II regression that includes error in both the iREC and creel estimates.  This similar approach could potentially be take when fitting historic catch models. This would allow the model fits to use the more certain catch estimates and reduce the influence of less certain estimates from either creel or iREC.



## Potential Catch Monitoring Improvements

A key component to supporting this combined method of estimating recreational catch is the operation of creel programs.  The fisher dependent nature of the iREC catch reporting can be lead to potential issues if it relied upon as the only source of catch.  As previously identified, fisher behaviour and participation rates can reduce the informational quality of iREC catch estimates.  Going forward, creel programs should be a key component of recreational catch monitoring to ensure the integrity of the recreational catch estimate.

As creel programs are a key to the recreational catch estimation methods identified in this report, creel program delivery may benefit from shifting priorities.  As identified, some past creel program data was excluded from the method due to lower quality estimates.  This may be because there isn't enough interviews or fly over coverage for each type of day (weekend or weekday) was not complete.  Where operationally feasible, it would be beneficial to focus creel sampling to a smaller set of areas and months with more data then trying to cover more areas with reduced data quality.  This would focus the creel program, particularly in the southern portion of BC, as a critical data set to calibrate iREC.

One key component to the quality of recreational catch estimates is how effective are fishers at communicating their catch data through the iREC reporting website.  Issues, such as misunderstanding the questions posed by the iREC survey or recall bias related to the time lag between catch and the reporting, can reduce the quality of data iREC provides.  Currently the primary way of address these issues on a per fisher level is limited to reviewing provided comments.  This does provide a rough understanding when there may be misunderstandings or issues with data entry.  However, a more effective approach maybe to explore collecting fisher identification information during creel interviews (e.g. iREC access keys).  The limited number of creel interviews in relation to the spatial and temporal coverage of iREC responses will likely not be informative to the calibration.  However, the creel interviews maybe used as an addition data set to identify potential systematic issues with how fishers use or understand how they use the website.  

A common concern with the iREC responses is recall bias that may result from the time lag between when the fishing event occurred and when they report the data.  In worse cases, this could be nearly a full month between releasing a fish and identifying the release to the department through iREC.  Any efforts to reduce this lag in reporting could potentially improve the overall quality of catch estimates, especially releases. One approach that fishers should be encouraged to do is track all catch on a catch report log that is filled out on the water.  DFO freely provides a document template ^[https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/rec/docs/track_catch-saisie_prises-eng.pdf] that fishers can print out and fill out while on the water.  In addition to the printed catch log, a electronic catch log maybe developed that would allow fishers to record catch information in a smart device. Any catch log solution must meet all the reporting needs of iREC (e.g. it must allow fishers to log all species and mark status for specific salmon species) to ensure the quality of catch monitoring program.

An important aspect to ensure quality results from iREC is for anglers knowing their responsibility to report their catch when they purchase a recreational licence.  One component of the angler population that can be challenging to collect quality data from is guided anglers.  These licence holders may not be as aware of the area they were fishing, what fish they may have released, or the specific species they caught.  A potential approach to improving the quality of responses for these anglers is to have guides facilitate their patrons' reporting.   This could accomplished through a range of actions, from a targeted communication campaign with guides to a potential mandatory guide reporting.  These approaches should be explored to ensure the quality of iREC response data from guided anglers.

# Conclusion
 
The primary goal of this work has been to incorporate direct catch estimates following a systematic, standardized, and replicable approach to better represent Canadian marine recreational fisheries impacts on Chinook stocks. In the past, different methods were inconsistently applied to incorporate catch data from different sources. This most recent update standardizes how the data is integrated into a recreational CWT estimate and how inconsistencies between sampling and catch estimates are handled. These updates leverage direct measurements and consistent methods to better reflect the recreational impacts on CWT indicator stocks since 2005. This standardization provides a framework to explore further improvements to better utilize recreational catch monitoring data and how to potentially improve catch monitoring programs in the future.
