#### Internet Recreational Catch (iREC) Survey - 

*This section to be replaced with paragraph from Rob and a new Appendix on iREC*

The mandatory internet recreational effort and catch (iREC) survey is a recent method for estimating recreational fishing effort and catch in Pacific Region tidal waters. The iREC survey annually provides catch estimates and associated precision across all tidal water Pacific Fishery Management Areas (PFMA's), licenced fishing methods, species and fates (retained or released) at a monthly resolution [@irec_sar_2015]. For all fishing methods besides boat-based angling -- specifically angling from shore, shellfish trapping from boat or shore, beach collecting, hand picking, diving, and other methods -- these are the first estimates available.

Despite this potential bias (*what bias?*), the iREC estimates are currently used, in a relative way, to prioritize the allocation of resources of creel surveys. Creel surveys are funded through contributions from Science (Salmon Stock Assessment) and Fisheries Management branches of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, ostensibly for the estimation of recreational salmon and Halibut catches although estimates for other finfish species are made. The iREC estimates of salmon and halibut catch, along with boat-based recreational angling effort, are used to rank the most important month and area combinations for creel survey allocation purposes. Currently, creel surveys are focused on month -- area combinations contributing the highest combined retained catches of Chinook Salmon and Halibut. In times and locations where fishing effort and catch of these important species are low, creel surveys are not currently conducted [@irec_sar_2015]. In fact, for many month -- PFMA combinations, creel surveys or other recreational monitoring approaches have never been used to estimate recreational fishing effort or catch. 

##### Survey License Selection

When the iREC survey initially began in 2012, survey participants were selected from a provided subset of licence holders that purchased through a web based license purchasing system. This subset excluded any paper-based licences that were issued outside the web-based system and typically consisted of approximately XX% of all recreational licence holders. This subset of licence holders were contacted by email with notification that they had been selected for the survey and provided instructions on how to report their fishing activity.

In more recent years (since 2018??) the iREC survey takes advantage of the web based purchasing of recreational licences to automatically select an licence holder to a survey and communicate what month they are to respond for. Random selections of fishers with licences active in a given month are obligated to provide details about their fishing activity and catch through a web-based survey tool. This fishing information from survey respondents is expanded to estimate total effort and catch following the methods described by Houtman et al. (2015).

The iREC survey is designed to provide month recreational catch estimates for every area within DFO's Pacific Region. When the survey was initially designed, the survey used the legal definition of Pacific Fishery Management Areas (PFMA) within the @pfma_2007.

##### License Stratification

When assessing survey responses, annual licences are unique compared to term licences as they can potentially fish any date after the licence purchase date and may be selected for one of several survey months within the licence year. To improve the representativeness of annual licence holders and provide more consistent precision across months within the year, the iREC licence selection process has used different stratification methods over the years. Over the years, the approach to stratification was adjusted to better align to improvements in the licence selection process and the increased number of selected licenses.

At the beginning of the iREC survey in 2012, licences were selected monthly after the licence was purchased. Selected licences were separated into a pre-selection and a post-selection strata based on whether they were selected for previous month or a future month. As nearly all term licences fish near the licence purchase date, which is before the selection date, they were all stratified as post-selection. However, annual licences may be selected for either the month they purchased in or a future survey month. Selected annual licences that were purchased during the survey month were put into the post-selection strata. If the survey month was for future month, then the licence is stratified as a post-selection strata. For example, if a licence was purchased on August 15th and they were selected for the August survey, the licence was stratified as a post-selection licence. However, if that same licence was selected for the October survey, the licence would be stratified as pre-selection.

Total annual catch estimates of boat-based angling would thus be equal to the sum of estimates from creel surveys for all months and areas where they occurred plus the calibrated iREC (iREC\*) estimates for all months and areas where they did not. Despite the apparent simplicity of this calibration method, there are outstanding issues regarding the use of creel survey estimates to calibrate iREC estimates; three of which we address here. First, creel surveys vary in sampling intensity and spatial and temporal coverage even with a particular month -- area estimate strata. This variability in the 'quality' of creel estimates (both in terms of accuracy and precision) may adversely affect calibration of iREC estimates. Second, variability in the relative strength and direction of "response bias" may influence the spatial or temporal patterns of bias in iREC estimates, with important implications for calibration. Finally, we combine information about the previous two issues to make recommendations about where, when and how to conduct relatively costly creel surveys to maximize their calibration value.



#### iREC to Creel Calibration

The apparent bias in iREC estimates could result from numerous sources. With an invitational fisher-dependent survey of this type, there is potential that the respondents to the survey are not representative of all licenced fishers. Such 'response bias' could result from differential response rates by successful or unsuccessful fishers, active or inactive fishers, people who tend to inaccurately report their catch for prestige or strategic reasons as well as problems with recalling the details of their fishing activity. The survey is designed to minimize bias where possible, but not all sources of bias can be completely addressed through design or education. Without a source of alternative estimates of high accuracy, the overall magnitude and direction of bias is difficult to quantify.

Where absolute estimates of effort and catch are demanded, such as for allocation decisions, stock assessments and catch reporting requirements, calibration of iREC estimates would be required. Calibrated iREC estimates for boat-based angling would be achieved by scaling iREC to creel estimates using the regression parameters (slope $m$) of iREC -- creel regressions for equivalent month -- area pairs. The calibrated iREC point estimates of boat-based angling effort or species specific catch ($iREC^*$) would be simply:

$$
iREC^*= creel = \frac{(iREC)}{m}
\label{eq:irec_calibration}
$$

The calibration coefficient $m$ is estimated annually using all area and month estimates of creel that are appropriate quality based on the criteria identified in the "South Coast Creel Survey quality control" section of this document.  Separate calibration factors are estimated for total kept and released catch, by species, for angling by boat.  As both the creel and iREC estimates have uncertainty associated with them, an error-in-variables approach is used to estimate $m$ using JAGS (@plummer2003jags) through the `rjags` R package (@rjags). The specific model code used is provided below, with `creel.obs` representing the creel estimate, `creel.se` representing the standard error of the creel estimate, and `iRec.obs` representing the iREC uncalibrated catch estimate for the same area and time as the creel estimate.

```{r methods jags, echo=TRUE}
model.jags <- function() {   
  for(i in 1:Ndata) {      
    #generate what true value may be based on se (notice that dnorm in jags      
    # uses 1/variance for second argument thus 1/SE^2)      
    creel.true[i] ~ dnorm(creel.obs[i], 1/creel.se[i]*1/creel.se[i])            
    #now for the actual regression equation     
    mu[i] <- beta1 * creel.true[i]      
    iRec.obs[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i], tau)   
  }      
  beta1 ~ dnorm(0, 0.0001)   
  tau ~ dgram(0.01, 0.01) 
  #a common prior for a variance term in vertical direction     
  #derived variables   
  sigma <- 1/sqrt(tau) 
  #std deviation about the regression line
}
